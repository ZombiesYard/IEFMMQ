B. When right engine RPM is above **10%**  
C. When right engine RPM is at or above **25%**  
D. Only after both engines are already running

**(Answer: C)**

---

### Q3. Left Engine Preconditions

Before moving the **ENG CRANK** switch to LEFT (to start the left engine), which
of the following should be true for the right engine?

A. Any RPM above 10% is sufficient  
B. RPM, temperature, fuel flow, nozzle position and oil pressure are all in normal ranges  
C. Only the fuel flow needs to be non-zero  
D. Only the nozzle position needs to be between 90–100%

**(Answer: B)**

---

### Q4. INS Mode

When should you set the **INS knob** to GND (ground) or CV (carrier)?

A. Immediately after turning on the battery  
B. After the left engine is running and stabilized (RPM greater than about 60%)  
C. Only after the aircraft is already taxiing  
D. Only after takeoff

**(Answer: B)**

---

### Q5. Purpose of the Fire Test

What is the purpose of running **FIRE TEST A and B** during the cold start?

A. To verify that the oxygen system is providing enough flow  
B. To warm up the radar and avionics  
C. To verify that fire detection and warning tones are working correctly  
D. To test the launch bar and arrestor hook mechanisms

**(Answer: C)**

---

### Q6. OBOGS

What is the role of **OBOGS** in the F/A-18C?

A. It controls fuel flow to both engines  
B. It generates onboard oxygen for the pilot  
C. It powers the radar and communication systems  
D. It manages hydraulic pressure for the flight controls

**(Answer: B)**

---

### Q7. Order of Early Power-Up Steps

Which of the following **best describes the correct order** at the very beginning
of the cold start procedure?

A. APU ON → Battery ON → Fire tests  
B. Fire tests → Battery ON → APU ON  
C. Battery ON → Generators checked → Fire tests → APU ON  
D. Battery ON → APU ON → Fire tests (while APU starts)

**(Intended “canonical” teaching order: C)**

**(Answer: C)**

---

### Q8. Displays and Pages

After bringing up the DDIs, MPCD and HUD, which pages are typically selected
for the F/A-18C cold start in this study?

A. Radar on both DDIs  
B. FCS page on the left DDI and BIT page on the right DDI  
C. HSI page on the left DDI and Stores page on the right DDI  
D. ENG page on the left DDI and HUD repeater on the right DDI

**(Answer: B)**

---

### Q9. FCS Preparation

Which of the following actions are part of **preparing the flight control system (FCS)** 
for takeoff? (Select *all* that apply.)

A. Pressing FCS RESET and monitoring the FCS page  
B. Setting the flap switch to AUTO (or HALF, depending on configuration)  
C. Running the FCS BIT (BIT switch + FCS OSB)  
D. Setting the INS knob to CV

**Correct answers: A, B, C**  
**(Scoring: 1 point only if A, B, C selected and D not selected)**

---

### Q10. Final Instrument Settings Before Taxi

Which of the following should normally be set or checked before releasing
the parking brake for taxi? (Select *all* that apply.)

A. BINGO fuel level on the IFEI  
B. Standby barometric altimeter set to airfield elevation  
C. Radar altimeter bug set to a reasonable low-altitude value (e.g., 200 ft)  
D. Attitude source set to AUTO and standby attitude indicator uncaged

**Correct answers: A, B, C, D**  
**(Scoring: e.g., 1 point if at least 3 of 4 correct without extra wrong options; 2 points if all 4 and no extras)**

---

### Q11. Sequence Mini-Task 1

Consider the following four steps:

1. Move ENG CRANK to RIGHT  
2. Set BATTERY switch to ON and confirm generators  
3. Move right throttle from OFF to IDLE (≥25% RPM)  
4. Turn APU switch to ON and wait for APU READY

Which option shows the **best** order for these steps?

A. 2 → 4 → 1 → 3  
B. 2 → 1 → 4 → 3  
C. 4 → 2 → 1 → 3  
D. 2 → 4 → 3 → 1  

**(Answer: A)**

---

### Q12. Sequence Mini-Task 2

Consider the following actions related to FCS and flaps:

1. Set flap switch to AUTO  
2. Run the FCS BIT (FCS BIT switch + FCS OSB)  
3. Press TAKEOFF TRIM  
4. Release parking brake

Which option shows a **reasonable order** for these actions during cold start?

A. 4 → 1 → 3 → 2  
B. 1 → 3 → 2 → 4  
C. 2 → 1 → 3 → 4  
D. 3 → 2 → 1 → 4  

**(Intended training order: flap config + trim + BIT, then later brake release)**  
**(Answer: B)**
