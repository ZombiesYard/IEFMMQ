# NASA Raw-TLX – Subjective Workload Questionnaire
## Task: F/A-18C Cold Start in DCS World (VR)

Please answer the following questions about **the cold start procedure you just performed**
in DCS World (F/A-18C, VR). There are no right or wrong answers – we are interested in
your **personal experience**.

For each scale, mark a value from **0 to 20**, where:

- 0 = Very low / very good
- 10 = Medium
- 20 = Very high / very poor

You can also use numbers in between (e.g., 7, 13, …).
