    This MVP covers steps S01-S10 (phases P1-P4) sufficient for an initial cold
    start. Remaining steps can be appended later using the same schema.

prerequisites:
  - "Aircraft cold and dark at ramp or carrier; parking brake set."
  - "Ground crew clear; chocks as per mission setup."
  - "Mission radios preset for training frequencies."
  - "Pilot seated with VR hardware on; UFC and DDIs visible."

completion_conditions:
  - "Right engine running with parameters verified in green ranges."
  - "Left engine crank sequence initiated and monitored per checklist."
  - "Both engines running and stabilized in green ranges."
  - "Safety-critical cautions resolved for current configuration (MVP S01-S10 scope)."
